<h1>Reveal: A jQuery Plugin For Modals</h1> <p>Reveal is a jQuery plugin for dead simple modals that comes with some sexy base CSS and can be implemented programatically or with the new HTML5 custom data attributes (data-attribute).</p>

<p>The original version of Reveal was deprecated the Foundation team and merged into the Foundation framework <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com">Foundation</a>.  This is a forked version of the original plugin that has been modernized for 2016.   I have incorporated some of the responsive css coding found in Foundation 5.x.   Additionally, there were a few changes needed for jQuery 1.9 and IOS visibility. I've rolled in some of the pull requests logged against Reveal.</p>

<p>This fork originated from the "de-Foundation-ing" of a WordPress theme I was working on.   Foundation turned out to be the wrong framework choice for this theme, though the requirement for a popup video remained.  As Reveal started of as a standalone jQuery plugin, I was able to keep Reveal around to meet the popup requirement.  Modernizing it turned out to be pretty straightforward.   I am providing this fork for those that might find themselves in a similar situation.</p>
